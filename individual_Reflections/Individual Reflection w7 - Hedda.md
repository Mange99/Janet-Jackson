## Individual Reflection w7 - Hedda
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
At the moment I feel like I have gotten the basic knowledge of how react works and type script as a language even though I have a long way to go. I still haven’t work with any UI elements. Nor have I been the scrum master. 
As such I want to take on a user story that involves more design aspects, I also want to be the scrum master to fully experience the role.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At the moment, as with previous sprints, I find it difficult to help  a team member to learn something new since I have the least knowledge about react, typescript etc. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? the team’s deliveries?

Individual Reflection w2 - Hedda

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Similar to last week I’m looking forward to better understand and work with SCRUM in a software development project.
Also, how to efficiently use Git is something I want to become better at.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week I have not gotten the opportunity to help anyone in the team with something. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Since we haven't really started using scrum I'm not sure about the nature of my contribution to the use of scrum.
I aim to actively implement scrum and contribute but giving inputs about the work flow.
     
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I have taken part in the team’s meetings and have done so actively. 
I have helped to create the Business Model Canvas and the overall description of the project.

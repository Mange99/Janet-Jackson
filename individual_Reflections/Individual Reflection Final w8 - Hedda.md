## Individual Reflection Final w8 - Hedda
### What do I want to learn or understand better?

A. During this project I have learnt plenty. Using react and typescript was a new experience for me and I had no previous knowledge. I now have developed basic knowledge of both react and typescript. I still feel somewhat insecure in that area. More importantly I have learnt a lot about scrum and its application and how to use agile practises to develop the work progress. I had the opportunity to be the scrum master which was insightful and enlightening. However I had this role during the last sprint so everyone new what needed to be done and no major challenges arose. 
B. I would want to become more secure and experienced in my role as a scrum master. I also want to feel more confident in my programming contribution towards the team. 
A->B. In a future project I would be scrum master earlier in the project in order to get a feel of the different challenges that arise early in projects. This would develop my scrum master abilities even more. Concerning programming I would try to pair-program more in the beginning. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A. To be frank this was an aspect I struggle with. I felt that my knowledge about programming was too basic to even help someone. I tried rather to help in other ways, such as explaining how to use Trello in the beginning etc. However, I still feel like I could have more of an effort in this regard. 
B. I would like to feel like I have helped team members in their struggles. 
A->B.  Find other ways I can contribute to the team. I doesn’t have to be about programming.
### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A. I would regard my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum as impactful. I used Trello in a way that made it easier for my team members to follow the progress of my user stories during the sprint. I also suggested that we needed to start with meeting on Wednesdays so that the team was more in sync and we could better adapt to challenges and needs. During the sprint retrospectives I tried to assess what practices worked and what we should bring with us to the following sprint. During the sprint planning I was an active participant and tried to contribute to estimation and making sure the overall goals of the sprints could be reached. 
B. I would like to develop my ability to write better user stories and acceptance criteras in the future. By having good user stories and clear acceptance criteria it becomes easier to use scrum. 
A -> B. I would keep on doing what I did during the last sprints in terms of using Trello and being active in sprint planning and other meeting. However I would start writing user stories earlier in the project. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

A. I have contributed  towards the team’s deliveries by making sure my user stories got done and added value to the PO. However, sometimes I felt limited in what I could accomplish in terms of the programming. 
B. I would like to take on more advance user stories and not feel limited by my own ability. 
A->B. I would try to pair-program more in the beginning and also take advantage of the skills and competence of my team members better by asking more about advice etc.

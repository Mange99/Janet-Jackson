Individual Reflection week 1 - Bilal

-what do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn how to organize the work in software engineering project and how to plan the project before working on it.
I want also to learn how to divide the work between the group members when working on a big software project.
I am also excited to learn new technology or framework in programming so it can help me in the future.

-how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Planning the sprints well and making sure that everyone in the team understands the plan, and helping the others if they get
stuck in something and be open and answer questions clearly.

-what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

We have not started with Scrum so i don't know exactly but i think every one should contribute in planning and review part,
the scrum master will have additional tasks but we have not decided yet who is going to be the Scrum master.

-what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
It is uncertain yet, but i will do my part in every sprint to push the project forward.

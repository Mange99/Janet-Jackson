Week 1 25/3-2022
What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn and understand SCRUM and agile development better to 
become more structured and efficient while working on software projects.
To learn this I should be part of all meetings and we should follow SCRUM and agile development practices.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can help my team by being part of our meetings and discussing how we want to do things and how to do things.
I feel confident in git, so I could/will probably help other team members if they feel insecure about using it.
We've also discussed using React and TypeScript which I have some experience with so I will try to teach them a little bit and 
show them some resources where they can learn if we choose to use this in the project. Also by being available and help anyone that needs it.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've been part of all team meetings and workshops this week. We have not done very much yet in respect to SCRUM.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I took part in the discussion and meeting where we wrote the social contract. This is so far the only deliverable we've done.


Week 2 1/4 - 2022
What do I want to learn or understand better?

It seems like the languages we have chosen are React and TypeScript. At the moment I feel like I can do stuff decently in them, 
but not very fast or accurately and also use them to their fullest extent and all their capabilites. 
I would like to be able to that more comfortably. I think by simply working in them I will learn a great deal.
The same goes for SCRUM, I have used it to some extent earlier but I want to learn more and be more
proficient in it, to do that I think using it will help a great deal.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can contribute to the learning process of everyone by being part of it and giving my view of things. I've shared some online resources with group members 
so they could learn some React before next week when we hopefully start coding.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have not yet done many SCRUM related activites except for the lessons. We have had some meetings where we discussed project ideas and the scope of it.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was part of a meeting where we together created the business model canvas and the project description. Some of the others had created some mockups and we gave them 
some input on what we thought of that. I also helped with finding apis and data we could use in our project,

Week 3 8/4 - 2022
What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to use SCRUM efficiently. I also want to become more proficient in our chosen framework and languages.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We've talked about doing some pair programming to help members that feel unsure.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I wrote a majority of the user stories. Me and Magnus also wrote the DoD and codestyle document. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I did my part in the userstories. I also helped with the team reflection although there was some misconception as to
when the meeting was supposed to be.

Week 4 22/4 - 2022
What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to become better in React and Typescript. And I want us as a team to work better in the sprints.
To achieve this we need to work more and not be afraid of taking on stuff we don't know much about.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Keep doing the pair programming if necessary. And always be there for questions if anything is unclear.
Next week I am going to be the scrummaster, so I should take on extra responsibility to make everything 
as clear and smooth as possible. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Being a part of the meetings and asking questions about things to make it clear. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I did my allotted userstory and I helped writing the team reflection.

Week 5 29/4 - 2022
What do I want to learn or understand better?
I continously want to get better and use more advanced features of React and TypeScript. To do this I should continue 
taking on tasks and keep working. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Share my knowledge by being available to anyone that needs it or has any questions. We as a team should also continue with pairprogramming and 
code review, so that if anyone sees anything that looks weird, we can give instant feedback. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I've been the scrummaster. I tried to delegate userstories according to everyones experience and I think it went well.
Everyone had something to do and they managed to do it in time. I held the scrum review/demo with the PO and also the scrum retrospective. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I did my share of tasks and reviewed code from teammembers. I took part in the team reflection. 

Week 6 6/5 - 2022
What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn and understand MongoDB better, I also want to become more comfortable with promises and asynchronous code. When I use async/await the 
code does what I expect it to do, but if I don't use it the code becomes unpredictable to me, .then(). I still want to become more proficient in React, i feel like 
my understanding of React has increased regarding knowledge of the virtual DOM and states but there is still much to learn. 
I also want to learn more about express servers and how one could set them up with routes and such things. I want to understand and use jwt:s better, right now they exist, but we don't 
do much with them. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Continue with pairprogramming and answer questions people may have in our communication channels. Have meetings with people to explain code and concepts 
they might not know or understand. Keep technical documentation with guides and where sequences are explained. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have taken part in all meetings this week. Sprint planning session, standup meetings, demo, review and retrospective.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I set up the server and database to allow for login and registration, and also make it easy for others to add functionality.
, which was my userstory this week, which I completed. I also took part in 
writing the team reflection.

Individual Reflection W6 - Sara

#### What do I want to learn or understand better?

I picked a programming based userstory this week, and some management/other related tasks--this allowed me to work on last weeks goal. I'm still a noob about react design related stuff. I think it could be useful to learn more about how react is used for design, to make the site more polished in its design. I will reach this by making sure I choose a user story next week where that is possible (if available and realistic, I suppose)--otherwise we are also closing in on the end of the project, so wrapping up stuff could also be good!

#### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
*this remains from last week as it is still relvant!*
I have some design experience. I want to share that with the group so we can have a ”pretty” website. I will work on learning how to the design programming for the website, and to help others in making the site ”pretty”. I also shared what I learnt from the relevant literature i read this week.

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
*this remains from last week as it is still relvant!*
I try and follow scrum to the best of my abilities. I Would like to make scrum work even better. I Will try and reach this by making concious decisions that help my scrum understanding, and take an eager part in the next scrum planning! 
One specific thing I did this week was read up on scrum through a project-relevant literature paper--Which I used to discuss scrum related things with the group.
     
#### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I delivered my user story (which was based on PO feedback) and took an active role in the turn in, additionally I had a few tasks that I also delivered. I want to continue doing what I assagned in time. I will reach that by continuing in the same manner—but possible even better!

*See team reflection w5 for better explanation for how these values are graded (not as simple as "time" might suggest).

Time: (on a scale of 1-10)  — 7. (Could be better in effincency--and I think I actually spent a little less time than last week--mostly because I misscalculated a tasks time.)
Stress: (on a scale of 1-10)  — 4. (it was ok)

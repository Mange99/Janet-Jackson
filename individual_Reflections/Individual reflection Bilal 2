Individual Reflection 2 - Bilal

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Like the last week i want to learn more about planning the project and how to work in Scrum
and to learn the new framework react

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week I have not gotten the opportunity to help anyone in the team with something. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have not began yet with scrum so i had no contribution on the team’s use of Scrum
     
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was in the meeting and helped the team with the planning for the project

## Individual Reflection w - Hedda
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
This sprint completed a user story that required me to program. I did learn from the process. I did face some difficulties, some of them I was able to sort out by my self and other I asked for help in discord. I have tried to use scrum efficiently during the sprint. I want to continue to develop how I use scrum in addition to my programming skills. Being scrum master next sprint is something that I think will help with that. 
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been using scrum and trello. Will keep on doing this. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
I have contributed to the completion of a user story and as such provided value to the customer. I have been active in meetings such as the sprint planning, Wednesday meeting and the sprint review. Lastly I contributed to the team reflection.

Individual Reflection 2 - Bilal

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Like the last week i want to learn more about planning the project and how to work in Scrum
and to learn the new framework react.
I want also to learn how to make good user stories and how to set a goal for a sprint

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Trying to expain what i knew about React or Scrum and answer questions if someone ask and help 
the others when needed.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week i have been in the meetings and did my part of the job that we planned in sprint planning
and i contributed in the planning and review of the the sprint and did my best so we follow Scrum.
     
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped the team to write the team reflection. For the product i have not worked a lot with it 
because the main goal of the sprint was to come along with react environment and to test how to create some components.

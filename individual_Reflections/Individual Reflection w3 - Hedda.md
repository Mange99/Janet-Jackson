## Individual Reflection w3 - Hedda
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to continue to learn typescript, react and implementation of scrum. At the moment my skills are basic in all above. To become better at typescript and react I plan on watching YouTube videos and practice a lot. Coding in pair i something I think will make me better and more confident as well. To become better at scrum I plan on reflecting throughout  the sprint on how the team is working and what we can do better. 
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Contributing to an open atmosphere so that when the need of a team member arise they will feel welcome to ask me anything. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contribution this week has been to remind the team of some scrum practices such as daily scrum meetings. During the sprint review I took an active part in evaluating our practices of scrum and saying what we as a group need to become better at in the coming sprints. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? the team’s deliveries?
This week my contribution was in the completion of a user story that made sure all members had a working work environment. As VS code is new to me this was something that even though considered easy, required time and energy of me. I also spent quite some time on the team reflection.

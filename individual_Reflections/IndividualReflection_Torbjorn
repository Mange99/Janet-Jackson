What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn and understand SCRUM and agile development better to 
become more structured and efficient while working on software projects.
To learn this I should be part of all meetings and we should follow SCRUM and agile development practices.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can help my team by being part of our meetings and discussing how we want to do things and how to do things.
I feel confident in git, so I could/will probably help other team members if they feel insecure about using it.
We've also discussed using React and TypeScript which I have some experience with so I will try to teach them a little bit and 
show them some resources where they can learn if we choose to use this in the project. Also by being available and help anyone that needs it.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've been part of all team meetings and workshops this week. We have not done very much yet in respect to SCRUM.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I took part in the discussion and meeting where we wrote the social contract. This is so far the only deliverable we've done.

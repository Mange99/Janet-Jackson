Individual Reflection W2 - Sara

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I am still unsure about some details about the project and scrum. And as stated last week I would like to improve my understanding of scrum, but additionally also of the programming tools that we will use in the course of the project. I will reach this by spending time learning these tools.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Having knowledge of scrum will allow me to do this more, (related to scrum).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I try and inform and discuss related scrum things. Additionally, I like to bring up the related topics for each meeting and deadline--so we work correctly, and hopefully according to scrum.
     
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have participated actively in assignments and meetings. I have mostly taken change with the mockup turn-in, and also made sure the actual canvas turn ins were handled this and last week.

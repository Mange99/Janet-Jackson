Individual Reflection 6 - Bilal

What do I want to learn or understand better?
In this sprint i and Ali was responsible for making the favorite function at the application and we could not finish it
this sprint because it was very big and we had to make an api for it so i want to learn how to use an api and connect it with
React for the next sprint

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week also i did my part and contributed with sprint planning and review 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped the team to write the team reflection. For the product we did not finish our user story so 
we will deliver it at the next sprint

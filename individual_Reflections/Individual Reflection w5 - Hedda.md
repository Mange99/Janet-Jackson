## Individual Reflection w5 - Hedda
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I did have a user story that required me to program this sprint. Nonetheless I still feel very much shaky in that regard.  Also, this week I met difficulties using gitHub. As such, I want to become more confident using gitHub. I plan to do so by taking advantage of my team members expertise on the subject. I also want to continue developing my understanding of react, the best way to do so i gather will be by pair-programming. 
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel like I have the least knowledge about the programming language and github and the technical aspects in the whole group. So how I would help someone would not be in that area. Regardless, by being open and sharing that which I find useful might help someone.
### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been using trello and our scrum board. I intend on keep on doing this. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? the team’s deliveries?
My contribution this sprint has been the user story concerning exercises relating to specific equipment. I was an active participant in the sprint review and actively contributed to the team reflection.

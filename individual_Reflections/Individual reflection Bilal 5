Individual Reflection 2 - Bilal

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Like the last week i want to learn more about planning the project and how to work in Scrum
and to learn the new framework react.
This week i want to learn also how to fetch data from an API and connect it with React.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week also i did my part and contributed with sprint planning and review 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped the team to write the team reflection. For the product i had a task to bring the data from an API 
and connect it with the react application so the user can see real exercises.

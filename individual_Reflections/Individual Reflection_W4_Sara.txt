Individual Reflection W4 - Sara

#### What do I want to learn or understand better?
(I was unable to reach my goal from last week on this point! I would like to do it this week.)

I still feel unsure about some of the programming aspect of our project. I want to understand (and feel more comfortable) with the programming aspect of our project. I will reach this by making sure I choose a user story next week where that is possible (if available and realistic, I suppose*).

Currently the website is quite barebones and WIP when in comes to design and reaching the look of the mockup we made early on. I would like to start on some of the design and frontend website stuff. I will do this by pushing and creating these user stories, and then selecting them myself, if possible.

#### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have some design experience. I want to share that with the group so we can have a ”pretty” website. I will work on learning how to the design programming for the website, and to help others in making the site ”pretty”.

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I take part in reminding each other of scrum methodologies and such. I also try and follow scrum to the best of my abilities. Would like to make scrum work even better. Will try and reach this by making concious decisions that help my scrum understanding.
     
#### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I delivered my user story. I took part in all the meetings, and took an active role in the turn in. I want to continue doing this. I will reach that by continuing in the same manner—but possible even better!

*See team reflection w4 for better explanation for how these values are graded.

Time: (on a scale of 1-10)  — 6. (Could be better, definitely. The week was a bit messy for me.)
Stress: (on a scale of 1-10)  — ≈ 6. (Stress not much related to project though)
Performance/productiveness: (on a scale of 1-10)  — 7. (Should have started earlier on my user story so I could have done another, I think.)

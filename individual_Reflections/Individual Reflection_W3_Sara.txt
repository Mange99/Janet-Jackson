Individual Reflection W3 - Sara

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I am still very new and unsure about react. I want to be more comfortable and knowledgeable about react. To reach this I will take a relevant user story that enables me to learn--and taking my time while doing so, to ensure learning.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Having knowledge of scrum and the agile process will allow me to do this more, (related to scrum).

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I try and inform and discuss related scrum things, I was also the scrum master this sprint week. Additionally, I like to bring up the related topics for each meeting and deadline--so we work correctly, and hopefully according to scrum. I would like to be a better scrum master next time it is my turn. I will do this by being more scrum knowledgeable and more use to the process.
     
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have participated actively in assignments and meetings. I finished my task, and worked on the team reflection a lot. I would like to deliver a bigger task next time. I will do this by taking a bigger task and finishing it.

Individual Reflection week 1 - Hedda

-   what do I want to learn or understand better?
	- I'm looking forward to better understand the work process in a software project. This include the planning phases, how the sprints are carried out and most importantly how the unknown is handle. The unknown is all that is not planned and accounted for. I'm certain that I as a member but also the team will encounter problems along the way. Solving these and continue to deliver value to the project will be teach me a lot. 
-   how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	- I aim to be openminded and help where ever I can. At the moment I'm uncertain how that will take place. 
-   what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	- Since we haven't really started using scrum I'm not sure about the nature of my contribution to the use of scrum. I aim to actively implement scrum and contribute but giving inputs about the work flow. 
-   what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	- At this moment, uncertain.
